> "For infrastructure technology, C will be hard to displace" - Dennis Ritchie

This quote is from Dennis Ritchie who along with Ken Thompson at Bell Labs  created the C programming language. Dennis was also one of the key developers in the Unix Operating system, and ad has won numerous awards including the Turing award. I would say his wisdom on the C programming language can be taken. C is a systems language here to stay, and learning it will help you learn any future systems language that may be developed.

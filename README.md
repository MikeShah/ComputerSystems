# Computer Systems

Some text-based notes from Computer Systems Lectures.

Consider these a stream of conciousness, very rough draft of what we talked about for the day. :)

The slides and other resources are likely the best source of information, but some students may find this useful. 

These notes will change often and may not be redistributed or hosted without prior written permission.
